# Contributing Guidelines 👼🏽 👩🏽‍💻 👇🏽

We are extremely excited to have you onboard with our project. We hope to see some great contributions from your end and thank you all for making this project successful. hugs

Before getting down to business, we believe to keep ourselves updated with the basics and so here are few extremely useful resources to get started with learning how to make contribution. Feel free to explore them :

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) : is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/) : Learn all about Github Flow, Git Commits, Making Pull Request, Forking Projects and more.

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

1. Reporting a bug
2. Discussing the current state of the code
3. Submitting a fix
4. Proposing new features

# We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
